=== Using Spring for Apache Kafka

==== Sending Messages

[[kafka-template]]
===== KafkaTemplate

The `KafkaTemplate` wraps a producer and provides convenience methods to send data to kafka topics.
Both asynchronous and synchronous methods are provided, with the async methods returning a `Future`.

[source, java]
----
ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(Integer partition, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(Integer partition, Long timestamp, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, Integer partition, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, Integer partition, Long timestamp, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(Message<?> message);

Map<MetricName, ? extends Metric> metrics();

List<PartitionInfo> partitionsFor(String topic);

<T> T execute(ProducerCallback<K, V, T> callback);

// Flush the producer.

void flush();

interface ProducerCallback<K, V, T> {

    T doInKafka(Producer<K, V> producer);

}

----

The `sendDefault` API requires that a default topic has been provided to the template.

The API which take in a `timestamp` as a parameter will store this timestamp in the record.
The behavior of the user provided timestamp is stored is dependent on the timestamp type configured on the Kafka topic.
If the topic is configured to use `CREATE_TIME` then the user specified timestamp will be recorded or generated if not specified.
If the topic is configured to use `LOG_APPEND_TIME` then the user specified timestamp will be ignored and broker will add in the local broker time.

The `metrics` and `partitionsFor` methods simply delegate to the same methods on the underlying https://kafka.apache.org/0101/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/Producer.html[`Producer`].
The `execute` method provides direct access to the underlying https://kafka.apache.org/0101/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/Producer.html[`Producer`].

To use the template, configure a producer factory and provide it in the template's constructor:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ProducerFactory<Integer, String> producerFactory() {
    return new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory<>(producerConfigs());
}

@Bean
public Map<String, Object> producerConfigs() {
    Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
    props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
    ...
    return props;
}

@Bean
public KafkaTemplate<Integer, String> kafkaTemplate() {
    return new KafkaTemplate<Integer, String>(producerFactory());
}
----

The template can also be configured using standard `<bean/>` definitions.

Then, to use the template, simply invoke one of its methods.

When using the methods with a `Message<?>` parameter, topic, partition and key information is provided in a message
header:

- `KafkaHeaders.TOPIC`
- `KafkaHeaders.PARTITION_ID`
- `KafkaHeaders.MESSAGE_KEY`
- `KafkaHeaders.TIMESTAMP`

with the message payload being the data.

Optionally, you can configure the `KafkaTemplate` with a `ProducerListener` to get an async callback with the
results of the send (success or failure) instead of waiting for the `Future` to complete.

[source, java]
----
public interface ProducerListener<K, V> {

    void onSuccess(String topic, Integer partition, K key, V value, RecordMetadata recordMetadata);

    void onError(String topic, Integer partition, K key, V value, Exception exception);

    boolean isInterestedInSuccess();

}
----

By default, the template is configured with a `LoggingProducerListener` which logs errors and does nothing when the
send is successful.

`onSuccess` is only called if `isInterestedInSuccess` returns `true`.

For convenience, the abstract `ProducerListenerAdapter` is provided in case you only want to implement one of the
methods.
It returns `false` for `isInterestedInSuccess`.

Notice that the send methods return a `ListenableFuture<SendResult>`.
You can register a callback with the listener to receive the result of the send asynchronously.

[source, java]
----
ListenableFuture<SendResult<Integer, String>> future = template.send("foo");
future.addCallback(new ListenableFutureCallback<SendResult<Integer, String>>() {

    @Override
    public void onSuccess(SendResult<Integer, String> result) {
        ...
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Throwable ex) {
        ...
    }

});
----

The `SendResult` has two properties, a `ProducerRecord` and `RecordMetadata`; refer to the Kafka API documentation
for information about those objects.

If you wish to block the sending thread, to await the result, you can invoke the future's `get()` method.
You may wish to invoke `flush()` before waiting or, for convenience, the template has a constructor with an `autoFlush`
parameter which will cause the template to `flush()` on each send.
Note, however that flushing will likely significantly reduce performance.

==== Receiving Messages

Messages can be received by configuring a `MessageListenerContainer` and providing a Message Listener, or by
using the `@KafkaListener` annotation.

[[message-listeners]]
===== Message Listeners

When using a <<message-listener-container, Message Listener Container>> you must provide a listener to receive data.
There are currently four supported interfaces for message listeners:

[source, java]
----
public interface MessageListener<K, V> {} <1>

    void onMessage(ConsumerRecord<K, V> data);

}

public interface AcknowledgingMessageListener<K, V> {} <2>

    void onMessage(ConsumerRecord<K, V> data, Acknowledgment acknowledgment);

}

public interface BatchMessageListener<K, V> {} <3>

    void onMessage(List<ConsumerRecord<K, V>> data);

}

public interface BatchAcknowledgingMessageListener<K, V> {} <4>

    void onMessage(List<ConsumerRecord<K, V>> data, Acknowledgment acknowledgment);

}
----

<1> Use this for processing individual `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using auto-commit, or one of the container-managed <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.

<2> Use this for processing individual `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using one of the manual <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.

<3> Use this for processing all `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using auto-commit, or one of the container-managed <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.
`AckMode.RECORD` is not supported when using this interface since the listener is given the complete batch.

<4> Use this for processing all `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using one of the manual <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.

[[message-listener-container]]
===== Message Listener Containers

Two `MessageListenerContainer` implementations are provided:

- `KafkaMessageListenerContainer`
- `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`

The `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` receives all message from all topics/partitions on a single thread.
The `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer` delegates to 1 or more `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` s to provide
multi-threaded consumption.

====== KafkaMessageListenerContainer

The following constructors are available.

[source, java]
----
public KafkaMessageListenerContainer(ConsumerFactory<K, V> consumerFactory,
                    ContainerProperties containerProperties)

public KafkaMessageListenerContainer(ConsumerFactory<K, V> consumerFactory,
                    ContainerProperties containerProperties,
                    TopicPartitionInitialOffset... topicPartitions)

----

Each takes a `ConsumerFactory` and information about topics and partitions, as well as other configuration in a `ContainerProperties`
object.
The second constructor is used by the `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer` (see below) to distribute `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` across the consumer instances.
`ContainerProperties` has the following constructors:

[source, java]
----
public ContainerProperties(TopicPartitionInitialOffset... topicPartitions)

public ContainerProperties(String... topics)

public ContainerProperties(Pattern topicPattern)
----

The first takes an array of `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` arguments to explicitly instruct the container which partitions to use
(using the consumer `assign()` method), and with an optional initial offset: a positive value is an absolute offset by default; a negative value is relative to the current last offset within a partition by default.
A constructor for `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` is provided that takes an additional `boolean` argument.
If this is `true`, the initial offsets (positive or negative) are relative to the current position for this consumer.
The offsets are applied when the container is started.
The second takes an array of topics and Kafka allocates the partitions based on the `group.id` property - distributing
partitions across the group.
The third uses a regex `Pattern` to select the topics.

Refer to the JavaDocs for `ContainerProperties` for more information about the various properties that can be set.

====== ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer

The single constructor is similar to the first `KafkaListenerContainer` constructor:

[source, java]
----
public ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer(ConsumerFactory<K, V> consumerFactory,
                            ContainerProperties containerProperties)

----

It also has a property `concurrency`, e.g. `container.setConcurrency(3)` will create 3 `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` s.

For the first constructor, kafka will distribute the partitions across the consumers.
For the second constructor, the `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer` distributes the `TopicPartition` s across the
delegate `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` s.

If, say, 6 `TopicPartition` s are provided and the `concurrency` is 3; each container will get 2 partitions.
For 5 `TopicPartition` s, 2 containers will get 2 partitions and the third will get 1.
If the `concurrency` is greater than the number of `TopicPartitions`, the `concurrency` will be adjusted down such that
each container will get one partition.

[[committing-offsets]]
====== Committing Offsets

Several options are provided for committing offsets.
If the `enable.auto.commit` consumer property is true, kafka will auto-commit the offsets according to its
configuration.
If it is false, the containers support the following `AckMode` s.

The consumer `poll()` method will return one or more `ConsumerRecords`; the `MessageListener` is called for each record;
the following describes the action taken by the container for each `AckMode` :

- RECORD - commit the offset when the listener returns after processing the record.
- BATCH - commit the offset when all the records returned by the `poll()` have been processed.
- TIME - commit the offset when all the records returned by the `poll()` have been processed as long as the `ackTime`
since the last commit has been exceeded.
- COUNT - commit the offset when all the records returned by the `poll()` have been processed as long as `ackCount`
records have been received since the last commit.
- COUNT_TIME - similar to TIME and COUNT but the commit is performed if either condition is true.
- MANUAL - the message listener is responsible to `acknowledge()` the `Acknowledgment`;
after which, the same semantics as `BATCH` are applied.
- MANUAL_IMMEDIATE - commit the offset immediately when the `Acknowledgment.acknowledge()` method is called by the
listener.

NOTE: `MANUAL`, and `MANUAL_IMMEDIATE` require the listener to be an `AcknowledgingMessageListener` or a `BatchAcknowledgingMessageListener`; see <<message-listeners, Message Listeners>>.

The `commitSync()` or `commitAsync()` method on the consumer is used, depending on the `syncCommits` container property.

The `Acknowledgment` has this method:

[source, java]
----
public interface Acknowledgment {

    void acknowledge();

}
----

This gives the listener control over when offsets are committed.

[[kafka-listener-annotation]]
===== @KafkaListener Annotation

The `@KafkaListener` annotation provides a mechanism for simple POJO listeners:

[source, java]
----
public class Listener {

    @KafkaListener(id = "foo", topics = "myTopic")
    public void listen(String data) {
        ...
    }

}
----

This mechanism requires an `@EnableKafka` annotation on one of your `@Configuration` classes and a listener container factory, which is used to configure the underlying
`ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`: by default, a bean with name `kafkaListenerContainerFactory` is expected.

[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableKafka
public class KafkaConfig {

    @Bean
    KafkaListenerContainerFactory<ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer<Integer, String>>
                        kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
        ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<Integer, String> factory =
                                new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
        factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());
        factory.setConcurrency(3);
        factory.getContainerProperties().setPollTimeout(3000);
        return factory;
    }

    @Bean
    public ConsumerFactory<Integer, String> consumerFactory() {
        return new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<>(consumerConfigs());
    }

    @Bean
    public Map<String, Object> consumerConfigs() {
        Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, embeddedKafka.getBrokersAsString());
        ...
        return props;
    }
}
----

Notice that to set container properties, you must use the `getContainerProperties()` method on the factory.
It is used as a template for the actual properties injected into the container.

You can also configure POJO listeners with explicit topics and partitions (and, optionally, their initial offsets):

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "bar", topicPartitions =
        { @TopicPartition(topic = "topic1", partitions = { "0", "1" }),
          @TopicPartition(topic = "topic2", partitions = "0",
             partitionOffsets = @PartitionOffset(partition = "1", initialOffset = "100"))
        })
public void listen(ConsumerRecord<?, ?> record) {
    ...
}
----

Each partition can be specified in the `partitions` or `partitionOffsets` attribute, but not both.

When using manual `AckMode`, the listener can also be provided with the `Acknowledgment`; this example also shows
how to use a different container factory.

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "baz", topics = "myTopic",
          containerFactory = "kafkaManualAckListenerContainerFactory")
public void listen(String data, Acknowledgment ack) {
    ...
    ack.acknowledge();
}
----

Finally, metadata about the message is available from message headers, the following header names can be used for retrieving the headers of the message:

- `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY`
- `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TOPIC`
- `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_PARTITION_ID`
- `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY`
- `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TIMESTAMP`
- `KafkaHeaders.TIMESTAMP_TYPE`


[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "qux", topicPattern = "myTopic1")
public void listen(@Payload String foo,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY) Integer key,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_PARTITION_ID) int partition,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TOPIC) String topic,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TIMESTAMP) long ts
        ) {
    ...
}
----

Starting with _version 1.1_, `@KafkaListener` methods can be configured to receive the entire batch of consumer records received from the consumer poll.
To configure the listener container factory to create batch listeners, set the `batchListener` property:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public KafkaListenerContainerFactory<?> batchFactory() {
    ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<Integer, String> factory =
            new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
    factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());
    factory.setBatchListener(true);  // <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    return factory;
}
----

To receive a simple list of payloads:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "list", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen(List<String> list) {
    ...
}
----

The topic, partition, offset etc are available in headers which parallel the payloads:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "list", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen(List<String> list,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY) List<Integer> keys,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_PARTITION_ID) List<Integer> partitions,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TOPIC) List<String> topics,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.OFFSET) List<Long> offsets) {
    ...
}
----

Alternatively you can receive a List of `Message<?>` objects with each offset, etc in each message, but it must be the only parameter (aside from an optional `Acknowledgment` when using manual commits) defined on the method:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "listMsg", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen14(List<Message<?>> list) {
    ...
}

@KafkaListener(id = "listMsgAck", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen15(List<Message<?>> list, Acknowledgment ack) {
    ...
}
----

You can also receive a list of `ConsumerRecord<?, ?>` objects but it must be the only parameter (aside from an optional `Acknowledgment` when using manual commits) defined on the method:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "listCRs", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen(List<ConsumerRecord<Integer, String>> list) {
    ...
}

@KafkaListener(id = "listCRsAck", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen(List<ConsumerRecord<Integer, String>> list, Acknowledgment ack) {
    ...
}
----

===== Container Thread Naming

Listener containers currently use two task executors, one to invoke the consumer and another which will be used to invoke the listener, when the kafka consumer property `enable.auto.commit` is `false`.
You can provide custom executors by setting the `consumerExecutor` and `listenerExecutor` properties of the container's `ContainerProperties`.
When using pooled executors, be sure that enough threads are available to handle the concurrency across all the containers in which they are used.
When using the `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`, a thread from each is used for each consumer (`concurrency`).

If you don't provide executors, `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor` s are used; these executors create threads with names `<beanName>-C-n` (consumer thread) and `<beanName>-L-n` (listener thread).
For the `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`, the `<beanName>` part of the thread name becomes `<beanName>-m`, where `m` represents the consumer instance.
`n` increments each time the container is started.
So, with a bean name of `container`, threads in this container will be named `container-0-C-1` and `container-0-L-1`, `container-1-C-1` etc., after the container is started the first time.

===== Filtering Messages

In certain scenarios, such as rebalancing, a message may be redelivered that has already been processed.
The framework cannot know whether such a message has been processed or not, that is an application-level
function.
This is known as the http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/IdempotentReceiver.html[Idempotent
Receiver] pattern and Spring Integration provides an
http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-endpoints-chapter.html#idempotent-receiver[implementation thereof].

The Spring for Apache Kafka project also provides some assistance by means of the `FilteringMessageListenerAdapter`
class, which can wrap your `MessageListener`.
This class takes an implementation of `RecordFilterStrategy` where you implement the `filter` method to signal
that a message is a duplicate and should be discarded.

A `FilteringAcknowledgingMessageListenerAdapter` is also provided for wrapping an `AcknowledgingMessageListener`.
This has an additional property `ackDiscarded` which indicates whether the adapter should acknowledge the discarded record; it is `true` by default.

When using `@KafkaListener`, set the `RecordFilterStrategy` (and optionally `ackDiscarded`) on the container factory and the listener will be wrapped in the appropriate filtering adapter.

Finally, `FilteringBatchMessageListenerAdapter` and `FilteringBatchAcknowledgingMessageListenerAdapter` are provided, for when using a batch <<message-listeners, message listener>>.

===== Retrying Deliveries

If your listener throws an exception, the default behavior is to invoke the `ErrorHandler`, if configured, or logged otherwise.

NOTE: Two error handler interfaces are provided `ErrorHandler` and `BatchErrorHandler`; the appropriate type must be configured to match the <<message-listeners, Message Listener>>.

To retry deliveries, convenient listener adapters - `RetryingMessageListenerAdapter` and `RetryingAcknowledgingMessageListenerAdapter` are provided, depending on whether you are using a `MessageListener` or an `AcknowledgingMessageListener`.

These can be configured with a `RetryTemplate` and `RecoveryCallback<Void>` - see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[spring-retry]
project for information about these components.
If a recovery callback is not provided, the exception is thrown to the container after retries are exhausted.
In that case, the `ErrorHandler` will be invoked, if configured, or logged otherwise.

When using `@KafkaListener`, set the `RetryTemplate` (and optionally `recoveryCallback`) on the container factory and the listener will be wrapped in the appropriate retrying adapter.

A retry adapter is not provided for any of the batch <<message-listeners, message listeners>>.

[[idle-containers]]
===== Detecting Idle Asynchronous Consumers

While efficient, one problem with asynchronous consumers is detecting when they are idle - users might want to take
some action if no messages arrive for some period of time.

You can configure the listener container to publish a `ListenerContainerIdleEvent` when some time passes with no message delivery.
While the container is idle, an event will be published every `idleEventInterval` milliseconds.

To configure this feature, set the `idleEventInterval` on the container:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public KafKaMessageListenerContainer(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    ContainerProperties containerProps = new ContainerProperties("topic1", "topic2");
    ...
    containerProps.setIdleEventInterval(60000L);
    ...
    KafKaMessageListenerContainer<String, String> container = new KafKaMessageListenerContainer<>(...);
    return container;
}
----

Or, for a `@KafkaListener`...

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
    ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<String, String> factory =
                new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
    ...
    factory.getContainerProperties().setIdleEventInterval(60000L);
    ...
    return factory;
}
----

In each of these cases, an event will be published once per minute while the container is idle.

====== Event Consumption

You can capture these events by implementing `ApplicationListener` - either a general listener, or one narrowed to only receive this specific event.
You can also use `@EventListener`, introduced in Spring Framework 4.2.

The following example combines the `@KafkaListener` and `@EventListener` into a single class.
It's important to understand that the application listener will get events for all containers so you may need to
check the listener id if you want to take specific action based on which container is idle.
You can also use the `@EventListener` `condition` for this purpose.

The events have 4 properties:

- `source` - the listener container instance
- `id` - the listener id (or container bean name)
- `idleTime` - the time the container had been idle when the event was published
- `topicPartitions` - the topics/partitions that the container was assigned at the time the event was generated

[source, xml]
----
public class Listener {

    @KafkaListener(id = "qux", topics = "annotated")
    public void listen4(@Payload String foo, Acknowledgment ack) {
        ...
    }

    @EventListener(condition = "event.listenerId.startsWith('qux-')")
    public void eventHandler(ListenerContainerIdleEvent event) {
        this.event = event;
        eventLatch.countDown();
    }

}
----

IMPORTANT: Event listeners will see events for all containers; so, in the example above, we narrow the events received based on the listener ID.
Since containers created for the `@KafkaListener` support concurrency, the actual containers are named `id-n` where the `n` is a unique value for each instance to support the concurrency.
Hence we use `startsWith` in the condition.

CAUTION: If you wish to use the idle event to stop the lister container, you should not call `container.stop()` on the thread that calls the listener - it will cause delays and unnecessary log messages.
Instead, you should hand off the event to a different thread that can then stop the container.
Also, you should not `stop()` the container instance in the event if it is a child container, you should stop the concurrent container instead.

====== Current Positions when Idle

Note that you can obtain the current positions when idle is detected by implementing `ConsumerSeekAware` in your listener; see `onIdleContainer()` in `<<seek>>.

===== Topic/Partition Initial Offset

There are several ways to set the initial offset for a partition.

When manually assigning partitions, simply set the initial offset (if desired) in the configured `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` arguments (see <<message-listener-container>>).
You can also seek to a specific offset at any time.

When using group management where the broker assigns partitions:

- For a new `group.id`, the initial offset is determined by the `auto.offset.reset` consumer property (`earliest` or `latest`).
- For an existing group id, the initial offset is the current offset for that group id.
You can, however, seek to a specific offset during initialization (or at any time thereafter).

[[seek]]
===== Seeking to a Specific Offset

In order to seek, your listener must implement `ConsumerSeekAware` which has the following methods:

[source, java]
----
void registerSeekCallback(ConsumerSeekCallback callback);

void onPartitionsAssigned(Map<TopicPartition, Long> assignments, ConsumerSeekCallback callback);

void onIdleContainer(Map<TopicPartition, Long> assignments, ConsumerSeekCallback callback);
----

The first is called when the container is started; this callback should be used when seeking at some arbitrary time after initialization.
You should save a reference to the callback; if you are using the same listener in multiple containers (or in a `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`) you should store the callback in a `ThreadLocal` or some other structure keyed by the listener `Thread`.

When using group management, the second method is called when assignments change.
You can use this method, for example, for setting initial offsets for the partitions, by calling the callback; you must use the callback argument, not the one passed into `registerSeekCallback`.
This method will never be called if you explicitly assign partitions yourself; use the `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` in that case.

The callback has these methods:

[source, java]
----
void seek(String topic, int partition, long offset);

void seekToBeginning(String topic, int partition);

void seekToEnd(String topic, int partition);
----

You can also perform seek operations from `onIdleContainer()` when an idle container is detected; see <<idle-containers>> for how to enable idle container detection.

To arbitrarily seek at runtime, use the callback reference from the `registerSeekCallback` for the appropriate thread.

[[serdes]]
==== Serialization/Deserialization and Message Conversion

Apache Kafka provides a high-level API for serializing/deserializing record values as well as their keys.
It is present with the `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serializer<T>` and
`org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer<T>` abstractions with some built-in implementations.
Meanwhile we can specify simple (de)serializer classes using Producer and/or Consumer configuration properties, e.g.:

[source, java]
----
props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, IntegerDeserializer.class);
props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class);
...
props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, IntegerSerializer.class);
props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);
----

for more complex or particular cases, the `KafkaConsumer`, and therefore `KafkaProducer`, provides overloaded
constructors to accept `(De)Serializer` instances for `keys` and/or `values`, respectively.

To meet this API, the `DefaultKafkaProducerFactory` and `DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory` also provide properties to allow
to inject a custom `(De)Serializer` to target `Producer`/`Consumer`.

For this purpose, Spring for Apache Kafka also provides `JsonSerializer`/`JsonDeserializer` implementations based on the
Jackson JSON object mapper.
The `JsonSerializer` is quite simple and just allows writing any Java object as a JSON `byte[]`, the `JsonDeserializer`
requires an additional `Class<?> targetType` argument to allow the deserialization of a consumed `byte[]` to the proper target
object.

[source, java]
----
JsonDeserializer<Bar> barDeserializer = new JsonDeserializer<>(Bar.class);
----

Both `JsonSerializer` and `JsonDeserializer` can be customized with an `ObjectMapper`.
You can also extend them to implement some particular configuration logic in the
`configure(Map<String, ?> configs, boolean isKey)` method.

Although the `Serializer`/`Deserializer` API is quite simple and flexible from the low-level Kafka `Consumer` and
`Producer` perspective, you might need more flexibility at the Spring Messaging level, either when using `@KafkaListener` or <<si-kafka,Spring Integration>>.
To easily convert to/from `org.springframework.messaging.Message`, Spring for Apache Kafka provides a `MessageConverter`
abstraction with the `MessagingMessageConverter` implementation and its `StringJsonMessageConverter` customization.
The `MessageConverter` can be injected into `KafkaTemplate` instance directly and via
`AbstractKafkaListenerContainerFactory` bean definition for the `@KafkaListener.containerFactory()` property:

[source, java]
----
@Bean

When using a `@KafkaListener`, the parameter type is provided to the message converter to assist with the conversion.

NOTE: When using the `StringJsonMessageConverter`, you should use a `StringDeserializer` in the kafka consumer configuration and `StringSerializer` in the kafka producer configuration, when using Spring Integration or the `KafkaTemplate.send(Message<?> message)` method.

==== Log Compaction

When using https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Log+Compaction[Log Compaction], it is possible to send and receive messages with `null` payloads which identifies the deletion of a key.

Starting with _version 1.0.3_, this is now fully supported.

To send a `null` payload using the `KafkaTemplate` simply pass null into the value argument of the `send()` methods.
One exception to this is the `send(Message<?> message)` variant.
Since `spring-messaging` `Message<?>` cannot have a `null` payload, a special payload type `KafkaNull` is used and the framework will send `null`.
For convenience, the static `KafkaNull.INSTANCE` is provided.

When using a message listener container, the received `ConsumerRecord` will have a `null` `value()`.

To configure the `@KafkaListener` to handle `null` payloads, you must use the `@Payload` annotation with `required = false`; you will usually also need the key so your application knows which key was "deleted":

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "deletableListener", topics = "myTopic")
public void listen(@Payload(required = false) String value, @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY) String key) {
    // value == null represents key deletion
}
----

When using a class-level `@KafkaListener`, some additional configuration is needed - a `@KafkaHandler` method with a `KafkaNull` payload:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "multi", topics = "myTopic")
static class MultiListenerBean {

    private final CountDownLatch latch1 = new CountDownLatch(2);

    @KafkaHandler
    public void listen(String foo) {
        ...
    }

    @KafkaHandler
    public void listen(Integer bar) {
        ...
    }

    @KafkaHandler
    public void delete(@Payload(required = false) KafkaNull nul, @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY) int key) {
        ...
    }

}
