=== Using Spring for Apache Kafka

==== Sending Messages

===== KafkaTemplate

The `KafkaTemplate` wraps a producer and provides convenience methods to send data to kafka topics.
Both asynchronous and synchronous methods are provided, with the async methods returning a `Future`.

[source, java]
----
ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(int partition, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, int partition, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, int partition, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(Message<?> message);

// Flush the producer.

void flush();
----

The first 3 methods require that a default topic has been provided to the template.

To use the template, configure a producer factory and provide it in the template's constructor:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ProducerFactory<Integer, String> producerFactory() {
    return new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory<>(producerConfigs());
}

@Bean
public Map<String, Object> producerConfigs() {
    Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
    props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
    ...
    return props;
}

@Bean
public KafkaTemplate<Integer, String> kafkaTemplate() {
    return new KafkaTemplate<Integer, String>(producerFactory());
}
----

The template can also be configured using standard `<bean/>` definitions.

Then, to use the template, simply invoke one of its methods.

When using the methods with a `Message<?>` parameter, topic, partition and key information is provided in a message
header:

- `KafkaHeaders.TOPIC`
- `KafkaHeaders.PARTITION_ID`
- `KafkaHeaders.MESSAGE_KEY`

with the message payload being the data.

Optionally, you can configure the `KafkaTemplate` with a `ProducerListener` to get an async callback with the
results of the send (success or failure) instead of waiting for the `Future` to complete.

[source, java]
----
public interface ProducerListener<K, V> {

    void onSuccess(String topic, Integer partition, K key, V value, RecordMetadata recordMetadata);

    void onError(String topic, Integer partition, K key, V value, Exception exception);

    boolean isInterestedInSuccess();

}
----

By default, the template is configured with a `LoggingProducerListener` which logs errors and does nothing when the
send is successful.

`onSuccess` is only called if `isInterestedInSuccess` returns `true`.

For convenience, the abstract `ProducerListenerAdapter` is provided in case you only want to implement one of the
methods.
It returns `false` for `isInterestedInSuccess`.

Notice that the send methods return a `ListenableFuture<SendResult>`.
You can register a callback with the listener to receive the result of the send asynchronously.

[source, java]
----
ListenableFuture<SendResult<Integer, String>> future = template.send("foo");
future.addCallback(new ListenableFutureCallback<SendResult<Integer, String>>() {

    @Override
    public void onSuccess(SendResult<Integer, String> result) {
        ...
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Throwable ex) {
        ...
    }

});
----

The `SendResult` has two properties, a `ProducerRecord` and `RecordMetadata`; refer to the Kafka API documentation
for information about those objects.

If you wish to block the sending thread, to await the result, you can invoke the future's `get()` method.
You may wish to invoke `flush()` before waiting or, for convenience, the template has a constructor with an `autoFlush`
parameter which will cause the template to `flush()` on each send.
Note, however that flushing will likely significantly reduce performance.

==== Receiving Messages

Messages can be received by configuring a `MessageListenerContainer` and providing a `MessageListener`, or by
using the `@KafkaListener` annotation.

===== Message Listener Containers

Two `MessageListenerContainer` implementations are provided:

- `KafkaMessageListenerContainer`
- `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`

The `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` receives all message from all topics/partitions on a single thread.
The `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer` delegates to 1 or more `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` s to provide
multi-threaded consumption.

====== KafkaMessageListenerContainer

The following constructors are available.

[source, java]
----
public KafkaMessageListenerContainer(ConsumerFactory<K, V> consumerFactory,
                    ContainerProperties containerProperties)

public KafkaMessageListenerContainer(ConsumerFactory<K, V> consumerFactory,
                    ContainerProperties containerProperties,
                    TopicPartitionInitialOffset... topicPartitions)

----

Each takes a `ConsumerFactory` and information about topics and partitions, as well as other configuration in a `ContainerProperties`
object.
The second constructor is used by the `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer` (see below) to distribute `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` across the consumer instances.
`ContainerProperties` has the following constructors:

[source, java]
----
public ContainerProperties(TopicPartitionInitialOffset... topicPartitions)

public ContainerProperties(String... topics)

public ContainerProperties(Pattern topicPattern)
----

The first takes an array of `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` arguments to explicitly instruct the container which partitions to use
(using the consumer `assign()` method), and with an optional initial offset: a positive value is an absolute offset by default; a negative value is relative to the current last offset within a partition by default.
A constructor for `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` is provided that takes an additional `boolean` argument.
If this is `true`, the initial offsets (positive or negative) are relative to the current position for this consumer.
The offsets are applied when the container is started.
The second takes an array of topics and Kafka allocates the partitions based on the `group.id` property - distributing
partitions across the group.
The third uses a regex `Pattern` to select the topics.

Refer to the JavaDocs for `ContainerProperties` for more information about the various properties that can be set.

====== ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer

The single constructor is similar to the first `KafkaListenerContainer` constructor:

[source, java]
----
public ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer(ConsumerFactory<K, V> consumerFactory,
                            ContainerProperties containerProperties)

----

It also has a property `concurrency`, e.g. `container.setConcurrency(3)` will create 3 `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` s.

For the first constructor, kafka will distribute the partitions across the consumers.
For the second constructor, the `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer` distributes the `TopicPartition` s across the
delegate `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` s.

If, say, 6 `TopicPartition` s are provided and the `concurrency` is 3; each container will get 2 partitions.
For 5 `TopicPartition` s, 2 containers will get 2 partitions and the third will get 1.
If the `concurrency` is greater than the number of `TopicPartitions`, the `concurrency` will be adjusted down such that
each container will get one partition.

====== Committing Offsets

Several options are provided for committing offsets.
If the `enable.auto.commit` consumer property is true, kafka will auto-commit the offsets according to its
configuration.
If it is false, the containers support the following `AckMode` s.

The consumer `poll()` method will return one or more `ConsumerRecords`; the `MessageListener` is called for each record;
the following describes the action taken by the container for each `AckMode` :

- RECORD - commit the offset when the listener returns after processing the record.
- BATCH - commit the offset when all the records returned by the `poll()` have been processed.
- TIME - commit the offset when all the records returned by the `poll()` have been processed as long as the `ackTime`
since the last commit has been exceeded.
- COUNT - commit the offset when all the records returned by the `poll()` have been processed as long as `ackCount`
records have been received since the last commit.
- COUNT_TIME - similar to TIME and COUNT but the commit is performed if either condition is true.
- MANUAL - the message listener (`AcknowledgingMessageListener`) is responsible to `acknowledge()` the `Acknowledgment`;
after which, the same semantics as `BATCH` are applied.
- MANUAL_IMMEDIATE - commit the offset immediately when the `Acknowledgment.acknowledge()` method is called by the
listener.

NOTE: `MANUAL`, and `MANUAL_IMMEDIATE` require the listener to be an `AcknowledgingMessageListener`.

The `commitSync()` or `commitAsync()` method on the consumer is used, depending on the `syncCommits` container property.

[source, java]
----
public interface AcknowledgingMessageListener<K, V> {

    void onMessage(ConsumerRecord<K, V> record, Acknowledgment acknowledgment);

}

public interface Acknowledgment {

    void acknowledge();

}
----

This gives the listener control over when offsets are committed.

===== @KafkaListener Annotation

The `@KafkaListener` annotation provides a mechanism for simple POJO listeners:

[source, java]
----
public class Listener {

    @KafkaListener(id = "foo", topics = "myTopic")
    public void listen(String data) {
        ...
    }

}
----

This mechanism requires a listener container factory, which is used to configure the underlying
`ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`: by default, a bean with name `kafkaListenerContainerFactory` is expected.

[source, java]
----
@Bean
KafkaListenerContainerFactory<ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer<Integer, String>>
                    kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
    ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<Integer, String> factory =
                            new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
    factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());
    factory.setConcurrency(3);
    factory.getContainerProperties().setPollTimeout(3000);
    return factory;
}

@Bean
public ConsumerFactory<Integer, String> consumerFactory() {
    return new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<>(consumerConfigs());
}

@Bean
public Map<String, Object> consumerConfigs() {
    Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
    props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, embeddedKafka.getBrokersAsString());
    ...
    return props;
}
----

Notice that to set container properties, you must use the `getContainerProperties()` method on the factory.
It is used as a template for the actual properties injected into the container.

You can also configure POJO listeners with explicit topics and partitions (and, optionally, their initial offsets):

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "bar", topicPartitions =
        { @TopicPartition(topic = "topic1", partitions = { "0", "1" }),
          @TopicPartition(topic = "topic2", partitions = "0",
             partitionOffsets = @PartitionOffset(partition = "1", initialOffset = "100"))
        })
public void listen(ConsumerRecord<?, ?> record) {
    ...
}
----

Each partition can be specified in the `partitions` or `partitionOffsets` attribute, but not both.

When using manual `AckMode`, the listener can also be provided with the `Acknowledgment`; this example also shows
how to use a different container factory.

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "baz", topics = "myTopic",
          containerFactory = "kafkaManualAckListenerContainerFactory")
public void listen(String data, Acknowledgment ack) {
    ...
    ack.acknowledge();
}
----

Finally, metadata about the message is available from message headers:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "qux", topicPattern = "myTopic1")
public void listen(@Payload String foo,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY) Integer key,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_PARTITION_ID) int partition,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TOPIC) String topic) {
    ...
}
----

===== Filtering Messages

In certain scenarios, such as rebalancing, a message may be redelivered that has already been processed.
The framework cannot know whether such a message has been processed or not, that is an application-level
function.
This is known as the http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/IdempotentReceiver.html[Idempotent
Receiver] pattern and Spring Integration provides an
http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-endpoints-chapter.html#idempotent-receiver[implementation thereof].

The Spring for Apache Kafka project also provides some assistance by means of the `FilteringMessageListenerAdapter`
class, which can wrap your `MessageListener`.
This class takes an implementation of `RecordFilterStrategy` where you implement the `filter` method to signal
that a message is a duplicate and should be discarded.

A `FilteringAcknowledgingMessageListenerAdapter` is also provided for wrapping an `AcknowledgingMessageListener`.
This has an additional property `ackDiscarded` which indicates whether the adapter should acknowledge the discarded record; it is `true` by default.

When using `@KafkaListener`, set the `RecordFilterStrategy` (and optionally `ackDiscarded`) on the container factory and the listener will be wrapped in the appropriate filtering adapter.


===== Retrying Deliveries

If your listener throws an exception, the default behavior is to invoke the `ErrorHandler`, if configured, or logged otherwise.

To retry deliveries, convenient listener adapters - `RetryingMessageListenerAdapter` and `RetryingAcknowledgingMessageListenerAdapter` are provided, depending on whether you are using a `MessageListener` or an `AcknowledgingMessageListener`.

These can be configured with a `RetryTemplate` and `RecoveryCallback<Void>` - see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[spring-retry]
project for information about these components.
If a recovery callback is not provided, the exception is thrown to the container after retries are exhausted.
In that case, the `ErrorHandler` will be invoked, if configured, or logged otherwise.

When using `@KafkaListener`, set the `RetryTemplate` (and optionally `recoveryCallback`) on the container factory and the listener will be wrapped in the appropriate retrying adapter.

==== Serialization/Deserialization and Message Conversion

Apache Kafka provides a high-level API for serializing/deserializing record values as well as their keys.
It is present with the `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serializer<T>` and
`org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer<T>` abstractions with some built-in implementations.
Meanwhile we can specify simple (de)serializer classes using Producer and/or Consumer configuration properties, e.g.:
[source, java]
----
props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, IntegerDeserializer.class);
props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class);
...
props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, IntegerSerializer.class);
props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);
----
for more complex or particular cases, the `KafkaConsumer`, and therefore `KafkaProducer`, provides overloaded
constructors to accept `(De)Serializer` instances for `keys` and/or `values`, respectively.

To meet this API, the `DefaultKafkaProducerFactory` and `DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory` also provide properties to allow
to inject a custom `(De)Serializer` to target `Producer`/`Consumer`.

For this purpose Spring for Apache Kafka also provides `JsonSerializer`/`JsonDeserializer` implementations based on the
Jackson JSON processor.
When `JsonSerializer` is pretty simple and just lets to write any Java object as a JSON `byte[]`, the `JsonDeserializer`
requires an additional `Class<?> targetType` argument to allow to deserializer consumed `byte[]` to the proper target
object.
The `JsonDeserializer` can be extended to the particular generic type, when the last one is resolved at runtime,
instead of compile-time additional `type` argument:
[source, java]
----
JsonDeserializer<Bar> barDeserializer = new JsonDeserializer<>(Bar.class);
...
JsonDeserializer<Foo> fooDeserializer = new JsonDeserializer<Foo>() { };
----
Both `JsonSerializer` and `JsonDeserializer` can be customized with provided `ObjectMapper`.
Plus you can extend them to implement some particular configuration logic in the
`configure(Map<String, ?> configs, boolean isKey)` method.

Although `Serializer`/`Deserializer` API is pretty simple and flexible from the low-level Kafka `Consumer` and
`Producer` perspective, it is not enough on the Messaging level, where `KafkaTemplate` and `@KafkaListener` are present.
To easy convert to/from `org.springframework.messaging.Message`, Spring for Apache Kafka provides `MessageConverter`
 abstraction with the `MessagingMessageConverter` implementation and its `StringJsonMessageConverter` customization.
The `MessageConverter` can be injected into `KafkaTemplate` instance directly and via
`AbstractKafkaListenerContainerFactory` bean definition for the `@KafkaListener.containerFactory()` property:
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public KafkaListenerContainerFactory<?> kafkaJsonListenerContainerFactory() {
    ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<Integer, String> factory =
        new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
    factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());
    factory.setMessageConverter(new StringJsonMessageConverter());
    return factory;
}
...
@KafkaListener(topics = "jsonData",
                containerFactory = "kafkaJsonListenerContainerFactory")
public void jsonListener(Foo foo) {
...
}
----

[[idle-containers]]
===== Detecting Idle Asynchronous Consumers

While efficient, one problem with asynchronous consumers is detecting when they are idle - users might want to take
some action if no messages arrive for some period of time.

You can configure the listener container to publish a `ListenerContainerIdleEvent` when some time passes with no message delivery.
While the container is idle, an event will be published every `idleEventInterval` milliseconds.

To configure this feature, set the `idleEventInterval` on the container:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public KafKaMessageListenerContainer(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    ContainerProperties containerProps = new ContainerProperties("topic1", "topic2");
    ...
    containerProps.setIdleEventInterval(60000L);
    ...
    KafKaMessageListenerContainer<String, String> container = new KafKaMessageListenerContainer<>(...);
    return container;
}
----

Or, for a `@KafkaListener`...

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
    ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<String, String> factory =
                new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
    ...
    factory.getContainerProperties().setIdleEventInterval(60000L);
    ...
    return factory;
}
----

In each of these cases, an event will be published once per minute while the container is idle.

====== Event Consumption

You can capture these events by implementing `ApplicationListener` - either a general listener, or one narrowed to only receive this specific event.
You can also use `@EventListener`, introduced in Spring Framework 4.2.

The following example combines the `@KafkaListener` and `@EventListener` into a single class.
It's important to understand that the application listener will get events for all containers so you may need to
check the listener id if you want to take specific action based on which container is idle.
You can also use the `@EventListener` `condition` for this purpose.

The events have 4 properties:

- `source` - the listener container instance
- `id` - the listener id (or container bean name)
- `idleTime` - the time the container had been idle when the event was published
- `topicPartitions` - the topics/partitions that the container was assigned at the time the event was generated

[source, xml]
----
public class Listener {

    @KafkaListener(id = "qux", topics = "annotated")
    public void listen4(@Payload String foo, Acknowledgment ack) {
        ...
    }

    @EventListener(condition = "event.listenerId.startsWith('qux-')")
    public void eventHandler(ListenerContainerIdleEvent event) {
        this.event = event;
        eventLatch.countDown();
    }

}
----

IMPORTANT: Event listeners will see events for all containers; so, in the example above, we narrow the events received based on the listener ID.
Since containers created for the `@KafkaListener` support concurrency, the actual containers are named `id-n` where the `n` is a unique value for each instance to support the concurrency.
Hence we use `startsWith` in the condition.

CAUTION: If you wish to use the idle event to stop the lister container, you should not call `container.stop()` on the thread that calls the listener - it will cause delays and unnecessary log messages.
Instead, you should hand off the event to a different thread that can then stop the container.
Also, you should not `stop()` the container instance in the event if it is a child container, you should stop the concurrent container instead.
