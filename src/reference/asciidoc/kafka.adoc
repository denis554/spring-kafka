=== Using Spring for Apache Kafka

==== Sending Messages

[[kafka-template]]
===== KafkaTemplate

The `KafkaTemplate` wraps a producer and provides convenience methods to send data to kafka topics.
Both asynchronous and synchronous methods are provided, with the async methods returning a `Future`.

[source, java]
----
ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(Integer partition, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> sendDefault(Integer partition, Long timestamp, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, Integer partition, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(String topic, Integer partition, Long timestamp, K key, V data);

ListenableFuture<SendResult<K, V>> send(Message<?> message);

Map<MetricName, ? extends Metric> metrics();

List<PartitionInfo> partitionsFor(String topic);

<T> T execute(ProducerCallback<K, V, T> callback);

// Flush the producer.

void flush();

interface ProducerCallback<K, V, T> {

    T doInKafka(Producer<K, V> producer);

}

----

The `sendDefault` API requires that a default topic has been provided to the template.

The API which take in a `timestamp` as a parameter will store this timestamp in the record.
The behavior of the user provided timestamp is stored is dependent on the timestamp type configured on the Kafka topic.
If the topic is configured to use `CREATE_TIME` then the user specified timestamp will be recorded or generated if not specified.
If the topic is configured to use `LOG_APPEND_TIME` then the user specified timestamp will be ignored and broker will add in the local broker time.

The `metrics` and `partitionsFor` methods simply delegate to the same methods on the underlying https://kafka.apache.org/0101/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/Producer.html[`Producer`].
The `execute` method provides direct access to the underlying https://kafka.apache.org/0101/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/Producer.html[`Producer`].

To use the template, configure a producer factory and provide it in the template's constructor:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ProducerFactory<Integer, String> producerFactory() {
    return new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory<>(producerConfigs());
}

@Bean
public Map<String, Object> producerConfigs() {
    Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
    props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
    ...
    return props;
}

@Bean
public KafkaTemplate<Integer, String> kafkaTemplate() {
    return new KafkaTemplate<Integer, String>(producerFactory());
}
----

The template can also be configured using standard `<bean/>` definitions.

Then, to use the template, simply invoke one of its methods.

When using the methods with a `Message<?>` parameter, topic, partition and key information is provided in a message
header:

- `KafkaHeaders.TOPIC`
- `KafkaHeaders.PARTITION_ID`
- `KafkaHeaders.MESSAGE_KEY`
- `KafkaHeaders.TIMESTAMP`

with the message payload being the data.

Optionally, you can configure the `KafkaTemplate` with a `ProducerListener` to get an async callback with the
results of the send (success or failure) instead of waiting for the `Future` to complete.

[source, java]
----
public interface ProducerListener<K, V> {

    void onSuccess(String topic, Integer partition, K key, V value, RecordMetadata recordMetadata);

    void onError(String topic, Integer partition, K key, V value, Exception exception);

    boolean isInterestedInSuccess();

}
----

By default, the template is configured with a `LoggingProducerListener` which logs errors and does nothing when the
send is successful.

`onSuccess` is only called if `isInterestedInSuccess` returns `true`.

For convenience, the abstract `ProducerListenerAdapter` is provided in case you only want to implement one of the
methods.
It returns `false` for `isInterestedInSuccess`.

Notice that the send methods return a `ListenableFuture<SendResult>`.
You can register a callback with the listener to receive the result of the send asynchronously.

[source, java]
----
ListenableFuture<SendResult<Integer, String>> future = template.send("foo");
future.addCallback(new ListenableFutureCallback<SendResult<Integer, String>>() {

    @Override
    public void onSuccess(SendResult<Integer, String> result) {
        ...
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Throwable ex) {
        ...
    }

});
----

The `SendResult` has two properties, a `ProducerRecord` and `RecordMetadata`; refer to the Kafka API documentation
for information about those objects.

If you wish to block the sending thread, to await the result, you can invoke the future's `get()` method.
You may wish to invoke `flush()` before waiting or, for convenience, the template has a constructor with an `autoFlush`
parameter which will cause the template to `flush()` on each send.
Note, however that flushing will likely significantly reduce performance.

[[transactions]]
===== Transactions

The 0.11.0.0 client library added support for transactions.
Spring for Apache Kafka adds support in several ways.

- `KafkaTransactionManager` - used with normal Spring transaction support (`@Transactional`, `TransactionTemplate` etc).
- Transactional `KafkaMessageListenerContainer`
- Local transactions with `KafkaTemplate`

Transactions are enabled by providing the `DefaultKafkaProducerFactory` with a `transactionIdPrefix`.
In that case, instead of managing a single shared `Producer`, the factory maintains a cache of transactional producers.
When the user `close()` s a producer, it is returned to the cache for reuse instead of actually being closed.
The `transactional.id` property of each producer is `transactionIdPrefix` + `n`, where `n` starts with `0` and is incremented for each new producer.

====== KafkaTransactionManager

The `KafkaTransactionManager` is an implementation of Spring Framework's `PlatformTransactionManager`; it is provided with a reference to the producer factory in its constructor.
If you provide a custom producer factory, it must support transactions - see `ProducerFactory.transactionCapable()`.

You can use the `KafkaTransactionManager` with normal Spring transaction support (`@Transactional`, `TransactionTemplate` etc).
If a transaction is active, any `KafkaTemplate` operations performed within the scope of the transaction will use the transaction's `Producer`.
The manager will commit or rollback the transaction depending on success or failure.
The `KafkaTemplate` must be configured to use the same `ProducerFactory` as the transaction manager.

====== Transactional Listener Container

You can provide a listener container with a `KafkaTransactionManager` instance; when so configured, the container will start a transaction before invoking the listener.
If the listener successfully processes the record (or records when using a `BatchMessageListener`), the container will send the offset(s) to the transaction using `producer.sendOffsetsToTransaction()`), before the transaction manager commits the transaction.
If the listener throws an exception, the transaction is rolled back and the consumer is repositioned so that the rolled-back records will be retrieved on the next poll.

====== KafkaTemplate Local Transactions

You can use the `KafkaTemplate` to execute a series of operations within a local transaction.

[source, java]
----
boolean result = template.executeInTransaction(t -> {
    t.sendDefault("foo", "bar");
    t.sendDefault("baz", "qux");
    return true;
});
----

The argument in the callback is the template itself (`this`).
If the callback exits normally, the transaction is committed; if an exception is thrown, the transaction is rolled-back.

NOTE: If there is a `KafkaTransactionManager` transaction in process, it will not be used; a new "nested" transaction is used.

==== Receiving Messages

Messages can be received by configuring a `MessageListenerContainer` and providing a Message Listener, or by
using the `@KafkaListener` annotation.

[[message-listeners]]
===== Message Listeners

When using a <<message-listener-container, Message Listener Container>> you must provide a listener to receive data.
There are currently eight supported interfaces for message listeners:

[source, java]
----
public interface MessageListener<K, V> { <1>

    void onMessage(ConsumerRecord<K, V> data);

}

public interface AcknowledgingMessageListener<K, V> { <2>

    void onMessage(ConsumerRecord<K, V> data, Acknowledgment acknowledgment);

}

public interface ConsumerAwareMessageListener<K, V> extends MessageListener<K, V> { <3>

    void onMessage(ConsumerRecord<K, V> data, Consumer<?, ?> consumer);

}

public interface AcknowledgingConsumerAwareMessageListener<K, V> extends MessageListener<K, V> { <4>

    void onMessage(ConsumerRecord<K, V> data, Acknowledgment acknowledgment, Consumer<?, ?> consumer);

}

public interface BatchMessageListener<K, V> { <5>

    void onMessage(List<ConsumerRecord<K, V>> data);

}

public interface BatchAcknowledgingMessageListener<K, V> { <6>

    void onMessage(List<ConsumerRecord<K, V>> data, Acknowledgment acknowledgment);

}

public interface BatchConsumerAwareMessageListener<K, V> extends BatchMessageListener<K, V> { <7>

    void onMessage(List<ConsumerRecord<K, V>> data, Consumer<?, ?> consumer);

}

public interface BatchAcknowledgingConsumerAwareMessageListener<K, V> extends BatchMessageListener<K, V> { <8>

    void onMessage(List<ConsumerRecord<K, V>> data, Acknowledgment acknowledgment, Consumer<?, ?> consumer);

}
----

<1> Use this for processing individual `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using auto-commit, or one of the container-managed <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.

<2> Use this for processing individual `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using one of the manual <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.

<3> Use this for processing individual `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using auto-commit, or one of the container-managed <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.
Access to the `Consumer` object is provided.

<4> Use this for processing individual `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using one of the manual <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.
Access to the `Consumer` object is provided.

<5> Use this for processing all `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using auto-commit, or one of the container-managed <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.
`AckMode.RECORD` is not supported when using this interface since the listener is given the complete batch.

<6> Use this for processing all `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using one of the manual <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.

<7> Use this for processing all `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using auto-commit, or one of the container-managed <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.
`AckMode.RECORD` is not supported when using this interface since the listener is given the complete batch.
Access to the `Consumer` object is provided.

<8> Use this for processing all `ConsumerRecord` s received from the kafka consumer `poll()` operation when
using one of the manual <<committing-offsets, commit methods>>.
Access to the `Consumer` object is provided.

IMPORTANT: The `Consumer` object is not thread-safe; you must only invoke its methods on the thread that calls the listener.

[[message-listener-container]]
===== Message Listener Containers

Two `MessageListenerContainer` implementations are provided:

- `KafkaMessageListenerContainer`
- `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`

The `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` receives all message from all topics/partitions on a single thread.
The `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer` delegates to 1 or more `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` s to provide
multi-threaded consumption.

====== KafkaMessageListenerContainer

The following constructors are available.

[source, java]
----
public KafkaMessageListenerContainer(ConsumerFactory<K, V> consumerFactory,
                    ContainerProperties containerProperties)

public KafkaMessageListenerContainer(ConsumerFactory<K, V> consumerFactory,
                    ContainerProperties containerProperties,
                    TopicPartitionInitialOffset... topicPartitions)

----

Each takes a `ConsumerFactory` and information about topics and partitions, as well as other configuration in a `ContainerProperties`
object.
The second constructor is used by the `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer` (see below) to distribute `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` across the consumer instances.
`ContainerProperties` has the following constructors:

[source, java]
----
public ContainerProperties(TopicPartitionInitialOffset... topicPartitions)

public ContainerProperties(String... topics)

public ContainerProperties(Pattern topicPattern)
----

The first takes an array of `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` arguments to explicitly instruct the container which partitions to use
(using the consumer `assign()` method), and with an optional initial offset: a positive value is an absolute offset by default; a negative value is relative to the current last offset within a partition by default.
A constructor for `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` is provided that takes an additional `boolean` argument.
If this is `true`, the initial offsets (positive or negative) are relative to the current position for this consumer.
The offsets are applied when the container is started.
The second takes an array of topics and Kafka allocates the partitions based on the `group.id` property - distributing
partitions across the group.
The third uses a regex `Pattern` to select the topics.

To assign a `MessageListener` to a container, use the `ContainerProps.setMessageListener` method when creating the Container:

[source, java]
----
ContainerProperties containerProps = new ContainerProperties("topic1", "topic2");
containerProps.setMessageListener(new MessageListener<Integer, String>() {
    ...
});
DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<Integer, String> cf =
                        new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<Integer, String>(consumerProps());
KafkaMessageListenerContainer<Integer, String> container =
                        new KafkaMessageListenerContainer<>(cf, containerProps);
return container;
----

Refer to the JavaDocs for `ContainerProperties` for more information about the various properties that can be set.

====== ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer

The single constructor is similar to the first `KafkaListenerContainer` constructor:

[source, java]
----
public ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer(ConsumerFactory<K, V> consumerFactory,
                            ContainerProperties containerProperties)

----

It also has a property `concurrency`, e.g. `container.setConcurrency(3)` will create 3 `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` s.

For the first constructor, kafka will distribute the partitions across the consumers.
For the second constructor, the `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer` distributes the `TopicPartition` s across the
delegate `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` s.

If, say, 6 `TopicPartition` s are provided and the `concurrency` is 3; each container will get 2 partitions.
For 5 `TopicPartition` s, 2 containers will get 2 partitions and the third will get 1.
If the `concurrency` is greater than the number of `TopicPartitions`, the `concurrency` will be adjusted down such that
each container will get one partition.

NOTE: The `client.id` property (if set) will be appended with `-n` where `n` is the consumer instance according to the concurrency.
This is required to provide unique names for MBeans when JMX is enabled.

[[committing-offsets]]
====== Committing Offsets

Several options are provided for committing offsets.
If the `enable.auto.commit` consumer property is true, kafka will auto-commit the offsets according to its
configuration.
If it is false, the containers support the following `AckMode` s.

The consumer `poll()` method will return one or more `ConsumerRecords`; the `MessageListener` is called for each record;
the following describes the action taken by the container for each `AckMode` :

- RECORD - commit the offset when the listener returns after processing the record.
- BATCH - commit the offset when all the records returned by the `poll()` have been processed.
- TIME - commit the offset when all the records returned by the `poll()` have been processed as long as the `ackTime`
since the last commit has been exceeded.
- COUNT - commit the offset when all the records returned by the `poll()` have been processed as long as `ackCount`
records have been received since the last commit.
- COUNT_TIME - similar to TIME and COUNT but the commit is performed if either condition is true.
- MANUAL - the message listener is responsible to `acknowledge()` the `Acknowledgment`;
after which, the same semantics as `BATCH` are applied.
- MANUAL_IMMEDIATE - commit the offset immediately when the `Acknowledgment.acknowledge()` method is called by the
listener.

NOTE: `MANUAL`, and `MANUAL_IMMEDIATE` require the listener to be an `AcknowledgingMessageListener` or a `BatchAcknowledgingMessageListener`; see <<message-listeners, Message Listeners>>.

The `commitSync()` or `commitAsync()` method on the consumer is used, depending on the `syncCommits` container property.

The `Acknowledgment` has this method:

[source, java]
----
public interface Acknowledgment {

    void acknowledge();

}
----

This gives the listener control over when offsets are committed.

[[kafka-listener-annotation]]
===== @KafkaListener Annotation

The `@KafkaListener` annotation provides a mechanism for simple POJO listeners:

[source, java]
----
public class Listener {

    @KafkaListener(id = "foo", topics = "myTopic")
    public void listen(String data) {
        ...
    }

}
----

This mechanism requires an `@EnableKafka` annotation on one of your `@Configuration` classes and a listener container factory, which is used to configure the underlying
`ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`: by default, a bean with name `kafkaListenerContainerFactory` is expected.

[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableKafka
public class KafkaConfig {

    @Bean
    KafkaListenerContainerFactory<ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer<Integer, String>>
                        kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
        ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<Integer, String> factory =
                                new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
        factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());
        factory.setConcurrency(3);
        factory.getContainerProperties().setPollTimeout(3000);
        return factory;
    }

    @Bean
    public ConsumerFactory<Integer, String> consumerFactory() {
        return new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<>(consumerConfigs());
    }

    @Bean
    public Map<String, Object> consumerConfigs() {
        Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, embeddedKafka.getBrokersAsString());
        ...
        return props;
    }
}
----

Notice that to set container properties, you must use the `getContainerProperties()` method on the factory.
It is used as a template for the actual properties injected into the container.

You can also configure POJO listeners with explicit topics and partitions (and, optionally, their initial offsets):

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "bar", topicPartitions =
        { @TopicPartition(topic = "topic1", partitions = { "0", "1" }),
          @TopicPartition(topic = "topic2", partitions = "0",
             partitionOffsets = @PartitionOffset(partition = "1", initialOffset = "100"))
        })
public void listen(ConsumerRecord<?, ?> record) {
    ...
}
----

Each partition can be specified in the `partitions` or `partitionOffsets` attribute, but not both.

When using manual `AckMode`, the listener can also be provided with the `Acknowledgment`; this example also shows
how to use a different container factory.

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "baz", topics = "myTopic",
          containerFactory = "kafkaManualAckListenerContainerFactory")
public void listen(String data, Acknowledgment ack) {
    ...
    ack.acknowledge();
}
----

Finally, metadata about the message is available from message headers, the following header names can be used for retrieving the headers of the message:

- `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY`
- `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TOPIC`
- `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_PARTITION_ID`
- `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TIMESTAMP`
- `KafkaHeaders.TIMESTAMP_TYPE`


[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "qux", topicPattern = "myTopic1")
public void listen(@Payload String foo,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY) Integer key,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_PARTITION_ID) int partition,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TOPIC) String topic,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TIMESTAMP) long ts
        ) {
    ...
}
----

Starting with _version 1.1_, `@KafkaListener` methods can be configured to receive the entire batch of consumer records received from the consumer poll.
To configure the listener container factory to create batch listeners, set the `batchListener` property:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public KafkaListenerContainerFactory<?> batchFactory() {
    ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<Integer, String> factory =
            new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
    factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());
    factory.setBatchListener(true);  // <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    return factory;
}
----

To receive a simple list of payloads:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "list", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen(List<String> list) {
    ...
}
----

The topic, partition, offset etc are available in headers which parallel the payloads:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "list", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen(List<String> list,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY) List<Integer> keys,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_PARTITION_ID) List<Integer> partitions,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TOPIC) List<String> topics,
        @Header(KafkaHeaders.OFFSET) List<Long> offsets) {
    ...
}
----

Alternatively you can receive a List of `Message<?>` objects with each offset, etc in each message, but it must be the only parameter (aside from an optional `Acknowledgment` when using manual commits) defined on the method:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "listMsg", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen14(List<Message<?>> list) {
    ...
}

@KafkaListener(id = "listMsgAck", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen15(List<Message<?>> list, Acknowledgment ack) {
    ...
}
----

You can also receive a list of `ConsumerRecord<?, ?>` objects but it must be the only parameter (aside from an optional `Acknowledgment` when using manual commits) defined on the method:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "listCRs", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen(List<ConsumerRecord<Integer, String>> list) {
    ...
}

@KafkaListener(id = "listCRsAck", topics = "myTopic", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void listen(List<ConsumerRecord<Integer, String>> list, Acknowledgment ack) {
    ...
}
----

Starting with _version 2.0_, the `id` attribute (if present) is used as the Kafka `group.id` property, overriding the configured property in the consumer factory, if present.
You can also set `groupId` explicitly, or set `idIsGroup` to false, to restore the previous behavior of using the consumer factory `group.id`.

===== Container Thread Naming

Listener containers currently use two task executors, one to invoke the consumer and another which will be used to invoke the listener, when the kafka consumer property `enable.auto.commit` is `false`.
You can provide custom executors by setting the `consumerExecutor` and `listenerExecutor` properties of the container's `ContainerProperties`.
When using pooled executors, be sure that enough threads are available to handle the concurrency across all the containers in which they are used.
When using the `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`, a thread from each is used for each consumer (`concurrency`).

If you don't provide a consumer executor, a `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor` is used; this executor creates threads with names `<beanName>-C-1` (consumer thread).
For the `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`, the `<beanName>` part of the thread name becomes `<beanName>-m`, where `m` represents the consumer instance.
`n` increments each time the container is started.
So, with a bean name of `container`, threads in this container will be named `container-0-C-1`, `container-1-C-1` etc., after the container is started the first time; `container-0-C-2`, `container-1-C-2` etc., after a stop/start.

[[class-level-kafkalistener]]
===== @KafkaListener on a class

When using `@KafkaListener` at the class-level, you specify `@KafkaHandler` at the method level.
When messages are delivered, the converted message payload type is used to determine which method to call.

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "multi", topics = "myTopic")
static class MultiListenerBean {

    @KafkaHandler
    public void listen(String foo) {
        ...
    }

    @KafkaHandler
    public void listen(Integer bar) {
        ...
    }

}
----

[[rebalance-listeners]]
===== Rebalance Listeners

`ContainerProperties` has a property `consumerRebalanceListener` which takes an implementation of the Kafka client's `ConsumerRebalanceListener` interface.
If this property is not provided, the container will configure a simple logging listener that logs rebalance events under the `INFO` level.
The framework also adds a sub-interface `ConsumerAwareRebalanceListener`:

[source, java]
----
public interface ConsumerAwareRebalanceListener extends ConsumerRebalanceListener {

    void onPartitionsRevokedBeforeCommit(Consumer<?, ?> consumer, Collection<TopicPartition> partitions);

    void onPartitionsRevokedAfterCommit(Consumer<?, ?> consumer, Collection<TopicPartition> partitions);

    void onPartitionsAssigned(Consumer<?, ?> consumer, Collection<TopicPartition> partitions);

}
----

Notice that there are two callbacks when partitions are revoked: the first is called immediately; the second is called after any pending offsets are committed.
This is useful if you wish to maintain offsets in some external repository; for example:

[source, java]
----
containerProperties.setConsumerRebalanceListener(new ConsumerAwareRebalanceListener() {

    @Override
    public void onPartitionsRevokedBeforeCommit(Consumer<?, ?> consumer, Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
        // acknowledge any pending Acknowledgments (if using manual acks)
    }

    @Override
    public void onPartitionsRevokedAfterCommit(Consumer<?, ?> consumer, Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
        // ...
            store(consumer.position(partition));
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public void onPartitionsAssigned(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
        // ...
            consumer.seek(partition, offsetTracker.getOffset() + 1);
        // ...
    }
});
----

[[annotation-send-to]]
===== Forwarding Listener Results using @SendTo

Starting with _version 2.0_, if you also annotate a `@KafkaListener` with a `@SendTo` annotation and the method invocation returns a result, the result will be forwared to the topic specified by the `@SendTo`.

The `@SendTo` value can have several forms:

- `@SendTo("someTopic")` routes to the literal topic
- `@SendTo("#{someExpression}")` routes to the topic determined by evaluating the expression once during application context initialization.
- `@SendTo("!{someExpression}")` routes to the topic determined by evaluating the expression at runtime.
The `#root` object for the evaluation has 3 properties:
  - request - the inbound `ConsumerRecord` (or `ConsumerRecords` object for a batch listener))
  - source - the `org.springframework.messaging.Message<?>` converted from the `request`.
  - result - the method return result.

The result of the expression evaluation must be a `String` representing the topic name.

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(topics = "annotated21")
@SendTo("!{request.value()}") // runtime SpEL
public String replyingListener(String in) {
    ...
}

@KafkaListener(topics = "annotated22")
@SendTo("#{myBean.replyTopic}") // config time SpEL
public Collection<String> replyingBatchListener(List<String> in) {
    ...
}

@KafkaListener(topics = "annotated23")
@SendTo("annotated23reply") // static reply topic definition
public String replyingListenerWithErrorHandler(String in) {
    ...
}
...
@KafkaListener(topics = "annotated25")
@SendTo("annotated25reply1")
public class MultiListenerSendTo {

    @KafkaHandler
    public String foo(String in) {
        ...
    }

    @KafkaHandler
    @SendTo("!{'annotated25reply2'}")
    public String bar(@Payload(required = false) KafkaNull nul,
            @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY) int key) {
        ...
    }

}
----

When using `@SendTo`, the `ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory` must be configured with a `KafkaTemplate` in its `replyTemplate` property, to perform the send.
Note: only the simple `send(topic, value)` method is used, so you may wish to create a subclass to generate the partition and/or key...

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public KafkaTemplate<String, String> myReplyingTemplate() {
    return new KafkaTemplate<Integer, String>(producerFactory()) {

        @Override
        public ListenableFuture<SendResult<String, String>> send(String topic, String data) {
            return super.send(topic, partitionForData(data), keyForData(data), data);
        }

        ...

    };
}
----

===== Filtering Messages

In certain scenarios, such as rebalancing, a message may be redelivered that has already been processed.
The framework cannot know whether such a message has been processed or not, that is an application-level
function.
This is known as the http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/IdempotentReceiver.html[Idempotent
Receiver] pattern and Spring Integration provides an
http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-endpoints-chapter.html#idempotent-receiver[implementation thereof].

The Spring for Apache Kafka project also provides some assistance by means of the `FilteringMessageListenerAdapter`
class, which can wrap your `MessageListener`.
This class takes an implementation of `RecordFilterStrategy` where you implement the `filter` method to signal
that a message is a duplicate and should be discarded.

A `FilteringAcknowledgingMessageListenerAdapter` is also provided for wrapping an `AcknowledgingMessageListener`.
This has an additional property `ackDiscarded` which indicates whether the adapter should acknowledge the discarded record; it is `true` by default.

When using `@KafkaListener`, set the `RecordFilterStrategy` (and optionally `ackDiscarded`) on the container factory and the listener will be wrapped in the appropriate filtering adapter.

In addition, a `FilteringBatchMessageListenerAdapter` is provided, for when using a batch <<message-listeners, message listener>>.

===== Retrying Deliveries

If your listener throws an exception, the default behavior is to invoke the `ErrorHandler`, if configured, or logged otherwise.

NOTE: Two error handler interfaces are provided `ErrorHandler` and `BatchErrorHandler`; the appropriate type must be configured to match the <<message-listeners, Message Listener>>.

To retry deliveries, convenient listener adapters - `RetryingMessageListenerAdapter` and `RetryingAcknowledgingMessageListenerAdapter` are provided, depending on whether you are using a `MessageListener` or an `AcknowledgingMessageListener`.

These can be configured with a `RetryTemplate` and `RecoveryCallback<Void>` - see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[spring-retry]
project for information about these components.
If a recovery callback is not provided, the exception is thrown to the container after retries are exhausted.
In that case, the `ErrorHandler` will be invoked, if configured, or logged otherwise.

When using `@KafkaListener`, set the `RetryTemplate` (and optionally `recoveryCallback`) on the container factory and the listener will be wrapped in the appropriate retrying adapter.

The contents of the `RetryContext` passed into the `RecoveryCallback` will depend on the type of listener.
The context will always have an attribute `record` which is the record for which the failure occurred.
If your listener is acknowledging and/or consumer aware, additional attributes `acknowledgment` and/or `consumer` will be available.
For convenience, the `RetryingAcknowledgingMessageListenerAdapter` provides static constants for these keys.
See its javadocs for more information.

A retry adapter is not provided for any of the batch <<message-listeners, message listeners>> because the framework has no knowledge of where, in a batch, the failure occurred.
Users wishing retry capabilities, when using a batch listener, are advised to use a `RetryTemplate` within the listener itself.

[[idle-containers]]
===== Detecting Idle Asynchronous Consumers

While efficient, one problem with asynchronous consumers is detecting when they are idle - users might want to take
some action if no messages arrive for some period of time.

You can configure the listener container to publish a `ListenerContainerIdleEvent` when some time passes with no message delivery.
While the container is idle, an event will be published every `idleEventInterval` milliseconds.

To configure this feature, set the `idleEventInterval` on the container:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public KafKaMessageListenerContainer(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    ContainerProperties containerProps = new ContainerProperties("topic1", "topic2");
    ...
    containerProps.setIdleEventInterval(60000L);
    ...
    KafKaMessageListenerContainer<String, String> container = new KafKaMessageListenerContainer<>(...);
    return container;
}
----

Or, for a `@KafkaListener`...

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
    ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<String, String> factory =
                new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
    ...
    factory.getContainerProperties().setIdleEventInterval(60000L);
    ...
    return factory;
}
----

In each of these cases, an event will be published once per minute while the container is idle.

====== Event Consumption

You can capture these events by implementing `ApplicationListener` - either a general listener, or one narrowed to only receive this specific event.
You can also use `@EventListener`, introduced in Spring Framework 4.2.

The following example combines the `@KafkaListener` and `@EventListener` into a single class.
It's important to understand that the application listener will get events for all containers so you may need to
check the listener id if you want to take specific action based on which container is idle.
You can also use the `@EventListener` `condition` for this purpose.

The events have 4 properties:

- `source` - the listener container instance
- `id` - the listener id (or container bean name)
- `idleTime` - the time the container had been idle when the event was published
- `topicPartitions` - the topics/partitions that the container was assigned at the time the event was generated

[source, xml]
----
public class Listener {

    @KafkaListener(id = "qux", topics = "annotated")
    public void listen4(@Payload String foo, Acknowledgment ack) {
        ...
    }

    @EventListener(condition = "event.listenerId.startsWith('qux-')")
    public void eventHandler(ListenerContainerIdleEvent event) {
        ...
    }

}
----

IMPORTANT: Event listeners will see events for all containers; so, in the example above, we narrow the events received based on the listener ID.
Since containers created for the `@KafkaListener` support concurrency, the actual containers are named `id-n` where the `n` is a unique value for each instance to support the concurrency.
Hence we use `startsWith` in the condition.

CAUTION: If you wish to use the idle event to stop the lister container, you should not call `container.stop()` on the thread that calls the listener - it will cause delays and unnecessary log messages.
Instead, you should hand off the event to a different thread that can then stop the container.
Also, you should not `stop()` the container instance in the event if it is a child container, you should stop the concurrent container instead.

====== Current Positions when Idle

Note that you can obtain the current positions when idle is detected by implementing `ConsumerSeekAware` in your listener; see `onIdleContainer()` in `<<seek>>.

===== Topic/Partition Initial Offset

There are several ways to set the initial offset for a partition.

When manually assigning partitions, simply set the initial offset (if desired) in the configured `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` arguments (see <<message-listener-container>>).
You can also seek to a specific offset at any time.

When using group management where the broker assigns partitions:

- For a new `group.id`, the initial offset is determined by the `auto.offset.reset` consumer property (`earliest` or `latest`).
- For an existing group id, the initial offset is the current offset for that group id.
You can, however, seek to a specific offset during initialization (or at any time thereafter).

[[seek]]
===== Seeking to a Specific Offset

In order to seek, your listener must implement `ConsumerSeekAware` which has the following methods:

[source, java]
----
void registerSeekCallback(ConsumerSeekCallback callback);

void onPartitionsAssigned(Map<TopicPartition, Long> assignments, ConsumerSeekCallback callback);

void onIdleContainer(Map<TopicPartition, Long> assignments, ConsumerSeekCallback callback);
----

The first is called when the container is started; this callback should be used when seeking at some arbitrary time after initialization.
You should save a reference to the callback; if you are using the same listener in multiple containers (or in a `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`) you should store the callback in a `ThreadLocal` or some other structure keyed by the listener `Thread`.

When using group management, the second method is called when assignments change.
You can use this method, for example, for setting initial offsets for the partitions, by calling the callback; you must use the callback argument, not the one passed into `registerSeekCallback`.
This method will never be called if you explicitly assign partitions yourself; use the `TopicPartitionInitialOffset` in that case.

The callback has these methods:

[source, java]
----
void seek(String topic, int partition, long offset);

void seekToBeginning(String topic, int partition);

void seekToEnd(String topic, int partition);
----

You can also perform seek operations from `onIdleContainer()` when an idle container is detected; see <<idle-containers>> for how to enable idle container detection.

To arbitrarily seek at runtime, use the callback reference from the `registerSeekCallback` for the appropriate thread.

[[serdes]]
==== Serialization/Deserialization and Message Conversion

Apache Kafka provides a high-level API for serializing/deserializing record values as well as their keys.
It is present with the `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serializer<T>` and
`org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer<T>` abstractions with some built-in implementations.
Meanwhile we can specify simple (de)serializer classes using Producer and/or Consumer configuration properties, e.g.:

[source, java]
----
props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, IntegerDeserializer.class);
props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class);
...
props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, IntegerSerializer.class);
props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);
----

for more complex or particular cases, the `KafkaConsumer`, and therefore `KafkaProducer`, provides overloaded
constructors to accept `(De)Serializer` instances for `keys` and/or `values`, respectively.

To meet this API, the `DefaultKafkaProducerFactory` and `DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory` also provide properties to allow
to inject a custom `(De)Serializer` to target `Producer`/`Consumer`.

For this purpose, Spring for Apache Kafka also provides `JsonSerializer`/`JsonDeserializer` implementations based on the
Jackson JSON object mapper.
The `JsonSerializer` is quite simple and just allows writing any Java object as a JSON `byte[]`, the `JsonDeserializer`
requires an additional `Class<?> targetType` argument to allow the deserialization of a consumed `byte[]` to the proper target
object.

[source, java]
----
JsonDeserializer<Bar> barDeserializer = new JsonDeserializer<>(Bar.class);
----

Both `JsonSerializer` and `JsonDeserializer` can be customized with an `ObjectMapper`.
You can also extend them to implement some particular configuration logic in the
`configure(Map<String, ?> configs, boolean isKey)` method.

Although the `Serializer`/`Deserializer` API is quite simple and flexible from the low-level Kafka `Consumer` and
`Producer` perspective, you might need more flexibility at the Spring Messaging level, either when using `@KafkaListener` or <<si-kafka,Spring Integration>>.
To easily convert to/from `org.springframework.messaging.Message`, Spring for Apache Kafka provides a `MessageConverter`
abstraction with the `MessagingMessageConverter` implementation and its `StringJsonMessageConverter` customization.
The `MessageConverter` can be injected into `KafkaTemplate` instance directly and via
`AbstractKafkaListenerContainerFactory` bean definition for the `@KafkaListener.containerFactory()` property:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public KafkaListenerContainerFactory<?> kafkaJsonListenerContainerFactory() {
    ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<Integer, String> factory =
        new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
    factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());
    factory.setMessageConverter(new StringJsonMessageConverter());
    return factory;
}
...
@KafkaListener(topics = "jsonData",
                containerFactory = "kafkaJsonListenerContainerFactory")
public void jsonListener(Foo foo) {
...
}
----

When using a `@KafkaListener`, the parameter type is provided to the message converter to assist with the conversion.

NOTE: When using the `StringJsonMessageConverter`, you should use a `StringDeserializer` in the kafka consumer configuration and `StringSerializer` in the kafka producer configuration, when using Spring Integration or the `KafkaTemplate.send(Message<?> message)` method.

[[headers]]
==== Message Headers

The 0.11.0.0 client introduced support for headers in messages.
Spring for Apache Kafka _version 2.0_ now supports mapping these headers to/from `spring-messaging` `MessageHeaders`.

NOTE: Previous versions mapped `ConsumerRecord` and `ProducerRecord` to spring-messaging `Message<?>` where the value property is mapped to/from the `payload` and other properties (`topic`, `partition`, etc) were mapped to headers.
This is still the case but additional, arbitrary, headers can now be mapped.

Apache Kafka headers have a simple API:

[source, java]
----
public interface Header {

    String key();

    byte[] value();

}
----

The `KafkaHeaderMapper` strategy is provided to map header entries between Kafka `Headers` and `MessageHeaders`:

[source, java]
----
public interface KafkaHeaderMapper {

    void fromHeaders(MessageHeaders headers, Headers target);

    void toHeaders(Headers source, Map<String, Object> target);

}
----

The `DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper` maps the key to the `MessageHeaders` header name and, in order to support rich header types, for outbound messages, JSON conversion is performed.
A "special" header, with key, `spring_json_header_types` contains a JSON map of `<key>:<type>`.
This header is used on the inbound side to provide appropriate conversion of each header value to the original type.

On the inbound side, all Kafka `Header` s are mapped to `MessageHeaders`.
On the outbound side, by default, all `MessageHeaders` are mapped except `id`, `timestamp`, and the headers that map to `ConsumerRecord` properties.

You can specify which headers are to be mapped for outbound messages, by providing patterns to the mapper.

[source, java]
----
public DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper() {
    ...
}

public DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper(ObjectMapper objectMapper) {
    ...
}

public DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper(String... patterns) {
    ...
}

public DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper(ObjectMapper objectMapper, String... patterns) {
    ...
}
----

The first constructor will use a default Jackson `ObjectMapper` and map most headers, as discussed above.
The second constructor will use the provided Jackson `ObjectMapper` and map most headers, as discussed above.
The third constructor will use a default Jackson `ObjectMapper` and map headers according to the provided patterns.
The third constructor will use the provided Jackson `ObjectMapper` and map headers according to the provided patterns.

Patterns are rather simple and can contain either a leading or trailing wildcard `*`, or both, e.g. `*.foo.*`.
Patterns can be negated with a leading `!`.
The first pattern that matches a header name wins (positive or negative).

When providing your own patterns, it is recommended to include `!id` and `!timestamp` since these headers are read-only on the inbound side.

IMPORTANT: By default, the mapper will only deserialize classes in `java.lang` and `java.util`.
You can trust other (or all) packages by adding trusted packages using the `addTrustedPackages` method.
If you are receiving messages from untrusted sources, you may wish to add just those packages that you trust.
To trust all packages use `mapper.addTrustedPackages("*")`.

The `DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper` is used in the `MessagingMessageConverter` by default.

==== Log Compaction

When using https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Log+Compaction[Log Compaction], it is possible to send and receive messages with `null` payloads which identifies the deletion of a key.

Starting with _version 1.0.3_, this is now fully supported.

To send a `null` payload using the `KafkaTemplate` simply pass null into the value argument of the `send()` methods.
One exception to this is the `send(Message<?> message)` variant.
Since `spring-messaging` `Message<?>` cannot have a `null` payload, a special payload type `KafkaNull` is used and the framework will send `null`.
For convenience, the static `KafkaNull.INSTANCE` is provided.

When using a message listener container, the received `ConsumerRecord` will have a `null` `value()`.

To configure the `@KafkaListener` to handle `null` payloads, you must use the `@Payload` annotation with `required = false`; you will usually also need the key so your application knows which key was "deleted":

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "deletableListener", topics = "myTopic")
public void listen(@Payload(required = false) String value, @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY) String key) {
    // value == null represents key deletion
}
----

When using a class-level `@KafkaListener`, some additional configuration is needed - a `@KafkaHandler` method with a `KafkaNull` payload:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "multi", topics = "myTopic")
static class MultiListenerBean {

    @KafkaHandler
    public void listen(String foo) {
        ...
    }

    @KafkaHandler
    public void listen(Integer bar) {
        ...
    }

    @KafkaHandler
    public void delete(@Payload(required = false) KafkaNull nul, @Header(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY) int key) {
        ...
    }

}
----

[[annotation-error-handling]]
==== Handling Exceptions

You can specify a global error handler used for all listeners in the container factory.

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public KafkaListenerContainerFactory<ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer<Integer, String>>
        kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
    ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<Integer, String> factory =
            new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
    ...
    factory.getContainerProperties().setErrorHandler(myErrorHandler);
    ...
    return factory;
}
----

By default, if an annotated listener method throws an exception, it is thrown to the container, and the message will handled according to the container configuration.
Nothing is returned to the sender.

Starting with _version 2.0_, the `@KafkaListener` annotation has a new attribute: `errorHandler`.

This attribute is not configured by default.

Use the `errorHandler` to provide the bean name of a `KafkaListenerErrorHandler` implementation.
This functional interface has one method:

[source, java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface KafkaListenerErrorHandler {

    Object handleError(Message<?> message, ListenerExecutionFailedException exception) throws Exception;

}
----

As you can see, you have access to the spring-messaging `Message<?>` object produced by the message converter and the exception that was thrown by the listener, wrapped in a `ListenerExecutionFailedException`.
The error handler can throw the original or a new exception which will be thrown to the container. Anything returned by the error handler is ignored.

It has a sub-interface `ConsumerAwareListenerErrorHandler` that has access to the consumer object, via the method:

[source, java]
----
Object handleError(Message<?> message, ListenerExecutionFailedException exception, Consumer<?, ?> consumer);
----

If your error handler implements this interface you can, for example, adjust the offsets accordingly.
For example, to reset the offset to replay the failed message, you could do something like the following; note however, these are simplistic implementations and you would probably want more checking in the error handler.

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ConsumerAwareListenerErrorHandler listen3ErrorHandler() {
    return (m, e, c) -> {
        this.listen3Exception = e;
        MessageHeaders headers = m.getHeaders();
        c.seek(new org.apache.kafka.common.TopicPartition(
                headers.get(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TOPIC, String.class),
                headers.get(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_PARTITION_ID, Integer.class)),
                headers.get(KafkaHeaders.OFFSET, Long.class));
        return null;
    };
}
----

And for a batch listener:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ConsumerAwareListenerErrorHandler listen10ErrorHandler() {
    return (m, e, c) -> {
        this.listen10Exception = e;
        MessageHeaders headers = m.getHeaders();
        List<String> topics = headers.get(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_TOPIC, List.class);
        List<Integer> partitions = headers.get(KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_PARTITION_ID, List.class);
        List<Long> offsets = headers.get(KafkaHeaders.OFFSET, List.class);
        Map<TopicPartition, Long> offsetsToReset = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < topics.size(); i++) {
            int index = i;
            offsetsToReset.compute(new TopicPartition(topics.get(i), partitions.get(i)),
                    (k, v) -> v == null ? offsets.get(index) : Math.min(v, offsets.get(index)));
        }
        offsetsToReset.forEach((k, v) -> c.seek(k, v));
        return null;
    };
}
----

This resets each topic/partition in the batch to the lowest offset in the batch.

Similarly, the container-level error handler (`ErrorHandler` and `BatchErrorHandler`) have sub-interfaces `ConsumerAwareErrorHandler` and `ConsumerAwareBatchErrorHandler` with method signatures:

[source, java]
----
void handle(Exception thrownException, ConsumerRecord<?, ?> data, Consumer<?, ?> consumer);

void handle(Exception thrownException, ConsumerRecords<?, ?> data, Consumer<?, ?> consumer);
----

respectively.

Similar to the `@KafkaListener` error handlers, you can reset the offsets as needed based on the data that failed.

NOTE: Unlike the listener-level error handlers, however, you should set the container property `ackOnError` to false when making adjustments; otherwise any pending acks will be applied after your repositioning.

[[kerberos]]
==== Kerberos

Starting with version 2.0 a `KafkaJaasLoginModuleInitializer` class has been added to assist with Kerberos configuration.
Simply add this bean, with the desired configuration, to your application context.

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public KafkaJaasLoginModuleInitializer jaasConfig() throws IOException {
    KafkaJaasLoginModuleInitializer jaasConfig = new KafkaJaasLoginModuleInitializer();
    jaasConfig.setControlFlag("REQUIRED");
    Map<String, String> options = new HashMap<>();
    options.put("useKeyTab", "true");
    options.put("storeKey", "true");
    options.put("keyTab", "/etc/security/keytabs/kafka_client.keytab");
    options.put("principal", "kafka-client-1@EXAMPLE.COM");
    jaasConfig.setOptions(options);
    return jaasConfig;
}
----
