=== Changes between 2.0 and 2.1

==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 1.0.0 `kafka-clients` or higher.

NOTE: The 1.1.x client is supported, with _version 2.1.5_, but you will need to override dependencies as described in <<deps-for-11x>>.
The 1.1.x client will be supported natively in _version 2.2_.

==== JSON Improvements

The `StringJsonMessageConverter` and `JsonSerializer` now add type information in `Headers`, allowing the converter and `JsonDeserializer` to create specific types on reception, based on the message itself rather than a fixed configured type.
See <<serdes>> for more information.


==== Container Stopping Error Handlers

Container Error handlers are now provided for both record and batch listeners that treat any exceptions thrown by the listener as fatal; they stop the container.
See <<annotation-error-handling>> for more information.

==== Pausing/Resuming Containers

The listener containers now have `pause()` and `resume()` methods (since _version 2.1.3_).
See <<pause-resume>> for more information.

==== Stateful Retry

Starting with _version 2.1.3_, stateful retry can be configured; see <<stateful-retry>> for more information.

==== Client ID

Starting with _version 2.1.1_, it is now possible to set the `client.id` prefix on `@KafkaListener`.
Previously, to customize the client id, you would need a separate consumer factory (and container factory) per listener.
The prefix is suffixed with `-n` to provide unique client ids when using concurrency.


==== Logging Offset Commits

By default, logging of topic offset commits is performed with the DEBUG logging level.
Starting with _version 2.1.2_, there is a new property in `ContainerProperties` called `commitLogLevel` which allows you to specify the log level for these messages.
See <<kafka-container>> for more information.

==== Default @KafkaHandler

Starting with _version 2.1.3_, one of the `@KafkaHandler` s on a class-level `@KafkaListener` can be designated as the default.
See <<class-level-kafkalistener>> for more information.

==== ReplyingKafkaTemplate

Starting with _version 2.1.3_, a subclass of `KafkaTemplate` is provided to support request/reply semantics.
See <<replying-template>> for more information.

==== ChainedKafkaTransactionManager

_version 2.1.3_ introduced the `ChainedKafkaTransactionManager` see <<chained-transaction-manager>> for more information.

==== Migration Guide from 2.0

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-kafka/wiki/Spring-for-Apache-Kafka-2.0-to-2.1-Migration-Guide[2.0 to 2.1 Migration].

=== Changes Between 1.3 and 2.0

==== Spring Framework and Java Versions

The Spring for Apache Kafka project now requires Spring Framework 5.0 and Java 8.

==== @KafkaListener Changes

You can now annotate `@KafkaListener` methods (and classes, and `@KafkaHandler` methods) with `@SendTo`.
If the method returns a result, it is forwarded to the specified topic.
See <<annotation-send-to>> for more information.

==== Message Listeners

Message listeners can now be aware of the `Consumer` object.
See <<message-listeners>> for more information.

==== ConsumerAwareRebalanceListener

Rebalance listeners can now access the `Consumer` object during rebalance notifications.
See <<rebalance-listeners>> for more information.

=== Changes Between 1.2 and 1.3

==== Support for Transactions

The 0.11.0.0 client library added support for transactions; the `KafkaTransactionManager` and other support for transactions has been added.
See <<transactions>> for more information.

==== Support for Headers

The 0.11.0.0 client library added support for message headers; these can now be mapped to/from `spring-messaging` `MessageHeaders`.
See <<headers>> for more information.

==== Creating Topics

The 0.11.0.0 client library provides an `AdminClient` which can be used to create topics.
The `KafkaAdmin` uses this client to automatically add topics defined as `@Bean` s.


==== Support for Kafka timestamps

`KafkaTemplate` now supports API to add records with timestamps.
New `KafkaHeaders` have been introduced regarding `timestamp` support.
Also new `KafkaConditions.timestamp()` and `KafkaMatchers.hasTimestamp()` testing utilities have been added.
See <<kafka-template>>, <<kafka-listener-annotation>> and <<testing>> for more details.

==== @KafkaListener Changes

You can now configure a `KafkaListenerErrorHandler` to handle exceptions.
See <<annotation-error-handling>> for more information.

By default, the `@KafkaListener` `id` property is now used as the `group.id` property, overriding the property configured in the consumer factory (if present).
Further, you can explicitly configure the `groupId` on the annotation.
Previously, you would have needed a separate container factory (and consumer factory) to use different `group.id` s for listeners.
To restore the previous behavior of using the factory configured `group.id`, set the `idIsGroup` property on the annotation to `false`.

==== @EmbeddedKafka Annotation

For convenience a test class level `@EmbeddedKafka` annotation is provided with the purpose to register `KafkaEmbedded` as a bean.
See <<testing>> for more information.

==== Kerberos Configuration

Support for configuring Kerberos is now provided.
See <<kerberos>> for more information.


=== Changes between 1.1 and 1.2

This version uses the 0.10.2.x client.

=== Changes between 1.0 and 1.1

==== Kafka Client

This version uses the Apache Kafka 0.10.x.x client.

==== Batch Listeners

Listeners can be configured to receive the entire batch of messages returned by the `consumer.poll()` operation, rather than one at a time.

==== Null Payloads

Null payloads are used to "delete" keys when using log compaction.

==== Initial Offset

When explicitly assigning partitions, you can now configure the initial offset relative to the current position for the consumer group, rather than absolute or relative to the current end.

==== Seek

You can now seek the position of each topic/partition.
This can be used to set the initial position during initialization when group management is in use and Kafka assigns the partitions.
You can also seek when an idle container is detected, or at any arbitrary point in your application's execution.
See <<seek>> for more information.
