=== Changes Between 1.2 and 1.3

==== Support for Transactions

The 0.11.0.0 client library added support for transactions; the `KafkaTransactionManager` and other support for transactions has been added.
See <<transactions>> for more information.

==== Support for Headers

The 0.11.0.0 client library added support for message headers; these can now be mapped to/from `spring-messaging` `MessageHeaders`.
See <<headers>> for more information.

==== Creating Topics

The 0.11.0.0 client library provides an `AdminClient` which can be used to create topics.
The `KafkaAdmin` uses this client to automatically add topics defined as `@Bean` s.


==== Support for Kafka timestamps

`KafkaTemplate` now supports API to add records with timestamps.
New `KafkaHeaders` have been introduced regarding `timestamp` support.
Also new `KafkaConditions.timestamp()` and `KafkaMatchers.hasTimestamp()` testing utilities have been added.
See <<kafka-template>>, <<kafka-listener-annotation>> and <<testing>> for more details.

==== @KafkaListener Changes

You can now configure a `KafkaListenerErrorHandler` to handle exceptions.
See <<annotation-error-handling>> for more information.

By default, the `@KafkaListener` `id` property is now used as the `group.id` property, overriding the property configured in the consumer factory (if present).
Further, you can explicitly configure the `groupId` on the annotation.
Previously, you would have needed a separate container factory (and consumer factory) to use different `group.id` s for listeners.
To restore the previous behavior of using the factory configured `group.id`, set the `idIsGroup` property on the annotation to `false`.

==== @EmbeddedKafka Annotation

For convenience a test class level `@EmbeddedKafka` annotation is provided with the purpose to register `KafkaEmbedded` as a bean.
See <<testing>> for more information.

==== Kerberos Configuration

Support for configuring Kerberos is now provided.
See <<kerberos>> for more information.


=== Changes between 1.1 and 1.2

This version uses the 0.10.2.x client.

=== Changes between 1.0 and 1.1

==== Kafka Client

This version uses the Apache Kafka 0.10.x.x client.

==== Batch Listeners

Listeners can be configured to receive the entire batch of messages returned by the `consumer.poll()` operation, rather than one at a time.

==== Null Payloads

Null payloads are used to "delete" keys when using log compaction.

==== Initial Offset

When explicitly assigning partitions, you can now configure the initial offset relative to the current position for the consumer group, rather than absolute or relative to the current end.

==== Seek

You can now seek the position of each topic/partition.
This can be used to set the initial position during initialization when group management is in use and Kafka assigns the partitions.
You can also seek when an idle container is detected, or at any arbitrary point in your application's execution.
See <<seek>> for more information.
