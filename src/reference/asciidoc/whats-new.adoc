=== What's new in 2.1 Since 2.0

==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 1.0.0 `kafka-clients` or higher.

==== JSON Improvements

The `StringJsonMessageConverter` and `JsonSerializer` now add type information in `Headers`, allowing the converter and `JsonDeserializer` to create specific types on reception, based on the message itself rather than a fixed configured type.
See <<serdes>> for more information.
