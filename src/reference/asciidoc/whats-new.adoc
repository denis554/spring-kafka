=== What's New in 2.3 Since 2.2

This section covers the changes made from version 2.2 to version 2.3.

[[kafka-client-2.1]]
==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 2.1.0 `kafka-clients` or higher.

==== Listener Contaienr Changes

Previously, error handlers received `ListenerExectionFailedException` (with the actual listener exception as the `cause`) when the listener was invoked using a listener adapter (such as `@KafkaListener` s).
Exceptions thrown by native `GenericMessageListener` s were passed to the error handler unchanged.
Now a `ListenerExecutionFailedException` is always the argument (with the actual listener exception as the `cause`), which provides access to the container's `group.id` property.
