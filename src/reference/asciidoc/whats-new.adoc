=== What's new in 1.1 Since 1.0

==== Kafka Client

This version uses the Apache Kafka 0.10.x.x client.

==== Batch Listeners

Listeners can be configured to receive the entire batch of messages returned by the `consumer.poll()` operation, rather than one at a time.

==== Null Payloads

Null payloads are used to "delete" keys when using log compaction.

==== Initial Offset

You can now configure the initial offset relative to the current position for the consumer group, rather than absolute or relative to the current end.
