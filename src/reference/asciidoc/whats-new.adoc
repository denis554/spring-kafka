=== What's new in 2.2 Since 2.1

==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 1.1.0 `kafka-clients` or higher.

==== Class/Package Changes

The class `ContainerProperties` has been moved from `org.springframework.kafka.listener.config` to `org.springframework.kafka.listener`.

The enum `AckMode` has been moved from `AbstractMessageListenerContainer` to `ContainerProperties`.

`setBatchErrorHandler()` and `setErrorHandler()` methods have been moved from `ContainerProperties` to `AbstractMessageListenerContainer` (and `AbstractKafkaListenerContainerFactory`).

==== After rollback processing

A new `AfterRollbackProcessor` strategy is provided - see <<after-rollback>> for more information.

==== ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory changes

The `ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory` can now be used to create/configure any `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`, not just those for `@KafkaListener` annotations.
See <<container-factory>> for more information.

==== Listener Container Changes

A new container property `missingTopicsFatal` has been added.

See <<kafka-container>> for more information.

A `ConsumerStoppedEvent` is now emitted when a consumer terminates.

See <<thread-safety>> for more information.

Batch listeners can optionally receive the complete `ConsumerRecords<?, ?>` object instead of a `List<ConsumerRecord<?, ?>`.

See <<batch-listeners>> for more information.

The `DefaultAfterRollbackProcessor` and `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` can now recover (skip) records that keep failing, and will do so after 10 failures, by default.
They can be configured to publish failed records to a dead-letter topic.

See <<after-rollback>>, <<seek-to-current>> and <<dead-letters>> for more information.

==== @KafkaListener Changes

You can now override the `concurrency` and `autoStartup` properties of the listener container factory by setting properties on the annotation.

See <<kafka-listener-annotation>> for more information.

==== Header Mapping Changes

Headers of type `MimeType` and `MediaType` are now mapped as simple strings in the `RecordHeader` value.
Previously, they were mapped as JSON and only `MimeType` was decoded, `MediaType` could not be decoded.
They are now simple strings for interoperability.

Also, the `DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper` has a new method `addToStringClasses` allowing the specification of types that should be mapped using `toString()` instead of JSON.

See <<headers>> for more information.

==== Embedded Kafka Changes

The `KafkaEmbedded` class and its `KafkaRule` interface have need deprecated in favor of the `EmbeddedKafkaBroker` and its JUnit 4 `EmbeddedKafkaRule` wrapper.
The `@EmbeddedKafka` annotation now populates an `EmbeddedKafkaBroker` bean instead of the deprecated `KafkaEmbedded`.
This allows the use of `@EmbeddedKafka` in JUnit 5 tests.

See <<testing>> for more information.

==== JsonSerializer/Deserializer Enhancements

You can now provide type mapping information using producer/consumer properties.

New constructors are available on the deserializer to allow overriding the type header information with the supplied target type.

See <<serdes>> for more information.

==== Kafka Streams Changes

The streams configuration bean must now be a simple `Properties` object instead of a `StreamsConfig`.

See <<kafka-streams>> for more information.
